<p>People are having a hard time trying to get rid of their benign bad habits but changing habits does not happen overnight and people are easily tempted to get back into the old habits. The problem is how can we induct behaviour change through a competitive and dynamic social environment.</p>
<h2>

</ul>
<h3>
<a id="user-content-time-addiction-and-therapy" class="anchor" href="#time-addiction-and-therapy" aria-hidden="true"></a>Time, addiction and therapy</h3>
<p>The Australian and New Zealand Obesity Society described the time it took for a habit to be broken as anywhere between 3-6 months. Similar treatment programs focused on narcotics and alcohol last more variable times - some last between 2-5, 6-12 and 13-52 weeks, though a study on the attendance and effectiveness of drug dependency programs emphasised the effectiveness of consistent attendance, as well as the effectiveness of follow-up programs. This study saw a strong correlation between weekly attendance and abstinence, and sporadic attendance and no attendance did not correlate with abstinence. As such, in an application that aims to target benign addictions, promoting consistency and frequent check-ins over at least a month should be prioritised.</p>
<h3>
<a id="user-content-motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation" aria-hidden="true"></a>Motivation</h3>
<p>The theory of human motivation is often approached using the concept of self-determination theory, which proposes that motivation exists on a spectrum of being controlled by external forces to being completely self-determined. This theory has formed the structure of many addiction treatment therapies, the progression of which can be seen in the patients as they move from participating in the therapy due to external (e.g social controls such as interventions or financial instability) to internal (e.g a desire for self improvement). In alcohol addiction treatment, motivation occurs when clients identify with the goals of treatment, and make a noticeable commitment to seek help, which is associated with high levels of interest, persistence and satisfaction. Conversely, without this internal motivation, patients were described as just <em>“going through the motions”</em>, seeking therapy due to external controls - the study [SOURCE] proposed that this was due to a subconscious attempt to preserve their own autonomy in the desire to continue abusing alcohol instead of actively choosing not to. As such, it can be understood that the goal of a program designed to target habits should be to promote the adoption of internal motivation over external motivation - therefore, when internal motivation is reached, the habit is broken. Motivation can also be driven by compensation - the BetterPoints [] application aims to target behaviours and habits through digital incentivisation, recognition and social interactions, by providing monthly bonuses and social rewards in conjunction with promoting positive intrinsic actions from activities, such as appreciating nature on a walk. It may also be interesting to analyse the effect of external social controls, such as shared experiences or competition, and its effect on motivating a patient. However, a study by the Australian and New Zealand obesity society conducted a study about motivation in an exergame, finding that competition was not correlated with motivation, while non-competitive people were more motivated in a non-competitive setting. As such, focusing on competition to motivate users may not be beneficial to the success of the application.</p>
<h3>
<a id="user-content-goals-and-techniques-of-therapy" class="anchor" href="#goals-and-techniques-of-therapy" aria-hidden="true"></a>Goals and techniques of therapy</h3>
<p>Behavioural therapy utilises several techniques in order to reframe habits and change the associations between a stimulus and a behaviour. A common technique, as explained by [] is to break an old habit while easing in a new one - this is done by: identifying behavioural triggers, forming contingencies and weakening relapse severity and reactions, reframing and re-labelling habitual situations, followed by the focus on mental effort and attention on prioritising the change in habit. The goal of the patient to understand the nature of an addiction is also seen in other behavioural therapy techniques, and again emphasises the need for internal rather than external addiction controls, as outlined in the previous paragraph. Therapy often involves an element of self-reflection, which is, as [] describes, beneficial to both the patient and therapist, as it encourages the patient to exercise emotional self-control, providing a basis of independence, while providing directions for the therapist to work off of. Another common technique used in therapy is to promote solidarity through the sharing experiences with addiction, which can be seen in the structure of <em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em> meetings. A study on <em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em> meetings in a group of Indigenous Australians described the sharing of experiences as well as the framing of said experiences through the “12 Steps”  as helping the reconstruction of the identity of the individual as well as the relationship with the addiction, by promoting an atmosphere of acceptance and responsibility. The theme of re-evaluating the individual’s relationship with the addiction is again brought up here, which corroborates the theories of external and internal motivation proposed in this paragraph as well as the previous paragraph on self-determination theory - the elimination of addictions is hence extremely focused around the re-framing of the relationship with the addiction, and should be a primary concern of the application.</p>
<h3>
<a id="user-content-design-opportunity" class="anchor" href="#design-opportunity" aria-hidden="true"></a>Design Opportunity?</h3>
<p>“...It can be difficult for people to improve their often benign bad habits, as it is not a problem area often targeted, and most existing solutions focus solely around the individual. It is hoped that through the design of a social application that focuses around connecting individuals and cultivating an atmosphere of friendly competition and solidarity through the ubiquity of smartphone technology that individuals are able to improve their lives for the better.”</p>
<p>Design opportunities are mainly focused around the use of a variety of incentives and creating an encouraging atmosphere for people to get rid of bad habits. “Bad” habits is self-definable by users, they have the rights to decide what habits that they want to get rid of. By creating an environment where people are encouraged to practice self-control, this could lead to a positive feedback loop for people to get rid of bad habits. Also, the definition of incentives are very different, here we are trying to make use of both intrinsic incentives as well as extrinsic incentives to develop users inner self-growth along with the help of external positive reinforcement. Furthermore, friendly competition is considered as to encourage people to help each other and make progress together.</p>

<p>Stemming from the key design opportunity of creating a fun, interesting way to change behaviours (making the long psychological change seem shorter), <a href="https://deco3500-2019.github.io/FoDoJoHo/" rel="nofollow">FoDoJoHo</a>  is proposing the Bad Habits Battle Royale application. Bad Habits Battle Royale utilises the popular video game genre of the <em>‘Battle Royale’</em> to help users slowly change their self-defined bad habits overtime. Similarly to a battle royale game, users will be placed in a virtual room with other users who are also experiencing the similar bad habit – this set of users will then compete against each other to see who can abstain from doing the bad habit. Each game will have a predefined round time (days to weeks) – if a user performs the bad habit before the end of the round they will ‘lose’; if a user does not perform the bad habit before the end of the round or lasts longer than the other users the will ‘win’. Each game a user partakes in will help them subconsciously practice self-control by restraining from performing their bad habit; each game a user plays helps them strive further away from their bad habit regardless of whether they technically win or lose.</p>
<p>Paragraph linking to research and social/mobile considerations</p>
<p>At this stage, FoDoJoHo are still considering multiple feature implementations that will change how the core system of Bad Habits Battle Royale functions. These elements have been listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extrinsic rewards system (user buy-in) - users will be required to ‘buy-in’ to each round with a small monetary amount ($0 - $2). This buy-in will be returned if a user successfully makes it through the round. If unsuccessful this buy-in will be split across the other ‘winners’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extrinsic rewards system (reputation) – users will be able to accumulate points based on victories and placements in each battle royale round. These points will act as a digital incentive and will encourage users to beat their peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection system (journal) – users can document behaviour-changing journey in a journal to allow them to reflect back on past successes and failures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application framing (‘Better’ Habit Battle Royale) – Better Habit Battle Royale will focus on encouraging positive habits rather than discouraging negative ones</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is hoped that the prototyping process will act as the primary method of discovery to help narrow down these options (insights may lead to further domain research/inquiry).</p>

<p>These are some of the apps are in a similar relm to our concept, however, that are merely a form of habit tracking applications and do not enforce the development of better and/or more life changing habits.</p>
<p>We can learn from the existing solutions and how they are approaching a similar market, and what successes and failures they have had. For example, according to an article in Time magazine, the <em>Tally app</em> is a &gt; “anything tracker” [4]. This is very vague and it is a that is best represented as the popular quote “Jack of trades, Master of none”. This is where we want to differ and focus on mastering the techniques to help people better their habits.</p>
<p>From the same article we found that <em>Habitshare</em> does a similar thing where the user is connected to their “friends” and they are in the journey together. This goes back to the theory of honesty and anonymity where users are more comfortable and honest when there is a greater degree of anonymity.[4][5]</p>
<p>Overall, the existing solutions aren’t bad by any means, however, their focus is more individual, whereas, we are focusing on the social part aspect of better habit formation</p>

<hr>
<p>In my experience as a student of user experience design, I have had the privilege to work on a variety of problem areas and domains, providing me with an adaptable and flexible technical and design skillset. I am fascinated by human behaviour and psychology, and how user experience design can influence our interactions with technology. I believe that my strengths lie in understanding and analysing data, using it to inform crucial design decisions. I have also been able to exercise this skill in conducting a variety of user-centred research methods such as design workshops, interviews or walkthroughs to get data that is both necessary and useful, while eliciting and discovering behaviours that may be unexpected. More often than not, these behaviours have had a significant impact on the design of a product - I have often been able to successfully pivot and rework existing concepts due to unexpected feedback.</p>

<hr>
<p>As a multimedia design student, I have had the opportunity to work on projects in a wide-breadth of domains, each requiring vastly different skills and knowledge. I strongly believe that this knowledge has equipped me with the ability to rapidly be able to learn new technologies that best fit the project goal I am working on. I work well under the challenge of starting a new project and iterating this through the design process to achieve a better overall result. I complete my best work around a deadline which sometimes limits my contribution to a project in earlier stages of development – this is something I still need to work on. I think this project will have some unique prototyping opportunities in regard to the battle royale element, so I hope to be able to work specifically on the development side of these – this feature will have a lot of discovery involved so I can definitely see a large learning and development opportunity in the future.</p>

<hr>
<p>As an IT software design student, I have completed courses that had me the ability to do various tasks and work on different areas. I believe that my knowledge and skills have ensured my ability to work our current project. My experience working as an UI/UX Specialist in a software development company had me a lot more real life experience in terms of developing software and designing good user experiences. I am able to work under pressure and set a positive tone to the development team. I have issues with time management when there is too much work - this is something that I should be working on. I think this project will involve a large part of user testing, prototyping and user research. I believe that with my level of user experience design skills, there wouldn’t be too much an issue for me to accomplish all the tasks.</p>

<hr>
<p>As a student and tutor of IT UX design. I have been exposed to a plethora of design workshops and skills. This has allowed me to better develop my own skills. I am currently tutoring DECO7140 and DECO1800, I believe this is a great way of reenforcing the knowledge I learnt in first year of university. I am also currently in a work experience program with the customer experience team Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR), specialising in the user Interaction and user experience side. I enjoy doing entrepreneurship and startup related events. I work closely with the UQ Ideahub team ,specially running events like weekend of startups. I recently did the Singapore Startup program where I was  paired with a social enterprise startup and we had to develop a product. Hence I am not new to this field. I am great at working under pressure and deliver what is needed. However, I also have flaws, I need to work on my time management skills and spreading out work to make it easier on me. I am working on making myself better this semester and I most certainly believe that this wide set of experiences, skills and knowledge will help me and our team to achieve greatness.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Diverse breadth of development knowledge – FoDoJoHo has a wide area of development experience, ranging from web applications to Unity projects to physical computing projects. This breadth will allow for the project’s technology to be chosen purely on the goals of the project (rather than constraining the project based off known technology).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong communication base and expectations – the members of FoDoJoHo have worked together in past projects and university assignments. This previous experience has already built the foundations for team communication and expectations – all members of FoDoJoHo will be on the same page going into this project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Affluency of visual design/user-interface skills – FoDoJoHo members have excelled in producing unique visual and user-interface designs in the past. These skills will prove useful in the upcoming project.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Readily accessible target audience – everyone has experienced a behaviour that they have deemed as a ‘bad habit’. This means data can be readily accessed on various different bad habits, how they form and the different triggers for each habit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Readily accessible resources – the topics of ‘changing behaviour’ and ‘habits’ have a plethora of related research and work already conducted. These works can provide unique insights into the topic and help inform the Bad Habits Battle Royale system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing non-social solutions – applications and systems already exist that attempt to fix bad habits or change user behaviours; these applications however focus on doing this on an individual basis rather than in a social setting. An existing solution analysis could provide unique insights into positive and negative aspects of these applications – these insights could help inform Bad Habits Battle Royale.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Staying on the same page project-wise – the process of completing different tasks and conducting user research with evolve our individual understanding of the domain space. There is the challenge of constantly sharing this new information back with the group to ensure that the team continually has a joint understanding of the project and its future direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exterior work/course commitments – differing work and course commitments adds the challenge of working uniformly on the project. FoDoJoHo will need to keep this in mind when delegating tasks throughout the semester.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>User research across a broad scope – there are many aspects of living that could be defined as a ‘bad habit’ by different people in different situations. This fact correlates to a large breadth of potential data that can be obtained via user research; this broad scope may lead to project challenges during design iteration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User research has potential to invade a sensitive subject area – as mentioned in the domain research section, people may feel uncomfortable sharing information about their bad habits, especially if their habits concern sensitive topics (Ong, A. D. &amp; Weiss, D. J., 2000). This factor will need to be addressed when designing user-research methods: e.g. interview questions should be carefully constructed to avoid digging too deep into sensitive subject areas.</p>

<p>The options analysis looks at the relevant opportunities and risks associated with designing and developing the proposed Bad Habits Battle Royale application.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scoping prototype size – opportunity to create an appropriate prototype that fits testing needs; risk to create a prototype that tries to test to much in one go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appropriate design and research approach – opportunity to find relevant research that informs design decisions moving forward; risk of spending too much time looking into research that is not as relevant to Bad Habits Battle Royale, leading to an incorrect design approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help resolve social stigmas – opportunity to allow users to open up about sensitive behavioural traits using accountable anonymity; risk of asking users to share too much information and unintentionally turning them away from the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering the potential reactions different users may have to the Bad Habits Battle Royale application is crucial when thinking about potential design considerations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Potential positive response – users may be thankful of the opportunity the application provides to share their bad habits and behaviour change process with others in a similar situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potential negative response – gamifying the behaviour change process could be interpreted negatively by some users; the validity of the application and its potential for success may come under fire because of this gamification</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarise, Team FoDoJoHo believes strongly that our skills can be brought together to effectively work within the ‘changing behaviours’ domain, however we also understand that there will be difficulties bringing together different perspectives on the topic (within and outside of the group) and applying these in a way that allows for the group to continually sustain a unanimous point of view; staying on the same page throughout each iteration of the project. FoDoJoHo looks forward to addressing the strengths, challenges, options and responses addressed above throughout the remaining duration of the semester.</p>
